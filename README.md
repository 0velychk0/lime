#lime - Light Media Engine

A lightweight pure OpenGL wrapper for [NME](http://github.com/haxenme/NME) and the nme build tools.

A good starting point for building OpenGL applications across Mac, Windows, Linux, Blackberry, HTML5(WebGL), Android, iOS.

#How it works

NME is a cross platform library, with a build tool, for building applications across many platforms. Frameworks like [OpenFL](http://github.com/openfl) leverage NME to implement a cross platform Flash API to great effect.

lime exposes the OpenGL layer across the platforms that support it, for developers to build new frameworks on top of.
